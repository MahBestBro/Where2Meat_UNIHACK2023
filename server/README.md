All the backend code for Where2Meat

If you want to have the backend work, you'll need to make your own .env file in this directory. In this file, create a variable called 'API_KEY' with your google api key as follows:

    "API_KEY="{YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}"

from there, it should work (hopefully *fingers_crossed*)
